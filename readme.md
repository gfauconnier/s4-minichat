#Week 4 : Minichat

##Presentation :
We had to create a basic __Minichat__ using Jquery.

##What's inside :
__index.html__ : I used 2 div, a textarea and a button.  
__main.css__ : Only a few flex declarations to position everything.  
__main.js__ : I used a click and a keypress(return) event to add p to the display div.  
I also added a timeout to simulate the answer (taking from an array).

##How ?  
Mostly JQuery + DOM
